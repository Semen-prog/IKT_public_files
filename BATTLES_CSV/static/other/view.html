is_hero:
Battle from original HERO (1984) data; if false, then from the LFW Management Associates, Inc. Report "Independent Review/Reassessment of Anomalous Data (IR/RAD)," 22 June 1987.  CDB90 combined the 600 battles from HERO (1984) with an additional 60 battles from the LWF (1987).
<br>
war2:
War name as indicated in HERO (1984) data For battles 600-660, they are assigned to the wars in the HERO 1984, or use the cdb90 war.
<br>
war3:
War, aggregating WWI, WWI, Napoleonic Wars, and the Arab-Israeli 1967 and 1973 wars
<br>
cow_warno: Correlates of War (COW) war number of the war in which the battle occured.<br>
cow_warname: Correlates of War (COW) war name of the war in which the battle occured.<br>
war4:
New war classification. Follows the wars in COW for battles after 1816, and the Wikipedia classification of wars for battles prior to that. Names are in the style of COW wars.
<br>
war4_theater: War theater. Only used for the larger wars.<br>
dbpedia:
URI for associated `dbpedia <http://dbpedia.org>`__ resource. These are easy to find for battles in the wars prior to WWI. It was harder to find these for WWI and later wars, and especially for the Arab-Israeli wars.
<br>
war_initiator: Was attacker in the battle on the side of the war initiator. This uses the COW war initiator coding for battles in COW wars, and the author's coding for battles not in COW wars.
<br>

duration_only: Duration given, but start and end times are unknown.
For some battles CDB90 indicates an exact duration without indicating the hours and minutes of the start and end times. If this variable is true, then the `duration_*` will not be a function of `start_time_*` and `end_time_*`.<br>
